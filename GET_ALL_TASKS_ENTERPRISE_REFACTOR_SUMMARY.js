-----------------------------

🎯 GET ALL TASKS ENDPOINT:
/api/GetAllTasks

OLD IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES:
❌ Manual requireAuth() without SecureEndpoint benefits
❌ Sequential Redis operations causing performance bottlenecks
❌ No response metadata for frontend optimization
❌ Basic error handling without specific error codes
❌ Individual completion status checks (N additional Redis calls)
❌ No audit logging for data access

NEW ENTERPRISE IMPLEMENTATION:
✅ SecureEndpoint handles authentication, rate limiting, and CORS
✅ Batch Redis operations with pipeline (massive performance improvement)
✅ Enhanced response with metadata for frontend optimization
✅ Structured error codes with comprehensive error handling

RESPONSE STRUCTURE:
Success: {
  tasks: Task[],
  totalCount: number,
  activeCount: number,
  completedCount: number,
  lastUpdated: string
}
Error: {
  success: false,
  errorCode: "SPECIFIC_ERROR_CODE",
  error: "Human readable message"
}

🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
----------------------------------

REDIS PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
OLD APPROACH:
1. Get task list: 1 Redis call
2. Get each task: N Redis calls
3. Check each completion: N Redis calls
Total: 1 + N + N = 1 + 2N Redis calls

NEW APPROACH:
1. Get task list: 1 Redis call  
2. Pipeline get all tasks: 1 Pipeline call
3. Pipeline check all completions: 1 Pipeline call
Total: 3 operations (massive reduction for large task lists)

SECUREENDPOINT INTEGRATION:
- Automatic JWT authentication

RESPONSE METADATA FOR FRONTEND:
- totalCount: Total number of tasks
- activeCount: Number of incomplete tasks  
- completedCount: Number of completed tasks
- lastUpdated: Timestamp for cache invalidation

CONDITIONAL APP PROVIDER INTEGRATION:
- Structured response fits perfectly with ConditionalAppProvider expectations
- Enhanced metadata enables smart frontend caching
- Error handling prevents server-side rendering failures
- Performance improvements reduce layout loading time

🔍 PERFORMANCE COMPARISON: BEFORE vs AFTER
==========================================

📋 REDIS OPERATIONS ANALYSIS:

OLD IMPLEMENTATION (Sequential):
const taskIds = await redis.lrange("task:list", 0, -1);  // 1 call

const tasks = await Promise.all(
  taskIds.map(async (taskId) => {
    const taskData = await redis.get(\`task:\${taskId}\`);  // N calls
    // ... process task
  })
);

const tasksWithCompletion = await Promise.all(
  validTasks.map(async (task) => {
    const completionKey = generateCompletionKey(task.period, task.id);
    const isCompleted = await redis.get(completionKey);  // N more calls
    return { ...task, completed: !!isCompleted };
  })
);

Total Redis Operations: 1 + N + N = 1 + 2N operations

📋 NEW IMPLEMENTATION (Batch Pipeline):
const taskIds = await redis.lrange("task:list", 0, -1);  // 1 call

// Batch fetch all task data
const pipeline = redis.pipeline();
taskIds.forEach(taskId => {
  pipeline.get(\`task:\${taskId}\`);  // 1 pipeline operation
});
const taskDataArray = await pipeline.exec();

// Batch fetch all completion status
const completionPipeline = redis.pipeline();
validTasks.forEach(task => {
  const completionKey = generateCompletionKey(task.period, task.id);
  completionPipeline.exists(completionKey);  // 1 pipeline operation
});
const completionResults = await completionPipeline.exec();

Total Redis Operations: 3 operations (regardless of task count!)
