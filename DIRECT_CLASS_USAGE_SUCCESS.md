# üéØ **Direct Class Usage Solution - SUCCESS!**

## ‚ùì **Your Question: Why Can't We Use the Logic from the Class Directly?**

Great question! The issue was **method visibility** in TypeScript/JavaScript classes.

## üîç **The Problem**

The `clearAuthCookies` method in your `RefreshApiAdapter` class was marked as **`private static`**:

```typescript
// ‚ùå BEFORE: Private method - can't be accessed externally
private static clearAuthCookies(response: NextResponse): void {
  // ... cookie clearing logic
}
```

### **Why We Couldn't Use It:**

1. **Private Access**: Only accessible within the `RefreshApiAdapter` class itself
2. **TypeScript Protection**: Compiler prevents accessing private members
3. **No Public API**: No way to call it from outside the class

## ‚úÖ **The Solution**

I made the method **`public static`** so it can be used across your authentication endpoints:

```typescript
// ‚úÖ AFTER: Public method - can be accessed externally
public static clearAuthCookies(response: NextResponse): void {
  // ‚úÖ SECURITY: Clear cookies with proper security settings
  response.cookies.set("access_token", "", {
    httpOnly: true,
    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production",
    sameSite: "strict",
    path: "/",
    expires: new Date(0), // Expire immediately
  });

  response.cookies.set("refresh_token", "", {
    httpOnly: true,
    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production",
    sameSite: "strict",
    path: "/",
    expires: new Date(0), // Expire immediately
  });
}
```

## üöÄ **Now Using It Directly**

### **In Logout Endpoint:**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ SUCCESS: Direct usage of the class method
RefreshApiAdapter.clearAuthCookies(response);
RefreshApiAdapter.clearAuthCookies(errorResponse);
```

### **Benefits:**

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All cookie clearing uses the same logic
2. **Consistency**: Guaranteed same security settings across endpoints
3. **Maintainability**: Changes to cookie logic only need to be made in one place
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support and intellisense

## üéâ **Result**

- ‚úÖ **Removed**: Helper function duplication
- ‚úÖ **Added**: Public access to `RefreshApiAdapter.clearAuthCookies()`
- ‚úÖ **Achieved**: Direct class method usage as requested
- ‚úÖ **Maintained**: All security features and enterprise-grade functionality

Your logout endpoint now directly uses your existing `RefreshApiAdapter` class method - exactly as you wanted!
