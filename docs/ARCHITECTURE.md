# Architecture

This document provides a high-level overview of the ChoreChamp system architecture.

## Frontend

The frontend is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application that uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for building the user interface. It is responsible for rendering the UI, handling user interactions, and communicating with the backend API.

## Backend

The backend is a [Next.js API](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) that is responsible for handling business logic, managing data, and authenticating users. It uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) to interact with the database.

## Database

The database is a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database that stores all of the application data, including users, tasks, and scores.

## Data Flow

The following diagram illustrates the data flow between the different parts of the system:

```
[User] -> [Frontend] -> [Backend API] -> [Database]
```

## Scaling Strategy

The application is designed to be scalable. The frontend can be deployed to a serverless platform like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), and the backend can be deployed to a containerized environment like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). The database can be scaled by using a managed database service like [Amazon RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) or [Google Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql).
