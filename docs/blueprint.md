## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Warm orange (#4F46E5) to signify energy and motivation in completing household tasks. Do not suggest teal!
- Background color: Very light orange (#FAFAFA), creating a bright and welcoming atmosphere.
- Accent color: Yellow-orange (#10B981), a contrasting color to draw attention to key actions and progress indicators.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines and short labels, with 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for longer descriptions or body text.
- Use simple and clear icons to represent each task type (daily, weekly, monthly) for quick recognition.
- Clean and spacious design that maximizes readability. Dashboard focus on clear task segregation per user, and task type. A progress widget will highlight floating point summary, progress percentages and pluses/minuses.
- Smooth animations to indicate task completion or reset actions. The 'Framer Motion' motion animation makes each change engaging to the eye, signalling when a new update or action happens.
