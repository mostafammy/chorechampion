/**
 * 🔧 DEBUGGING MODE ACTIVATED! 🔧
 * ===============================
 *
 * Temporarily disabled ALL authentication guards to debug login page access.
 * This will help us identify where the "Authentication Required" message is coming from.
 */

console.log("🛠️ AUTHENTICATION DEBUGGING MODE!");

/**
 * 🎯 CURRENT DEBUG SETUP:
 * =======================
 *
 * CHANGES MADE:
 * ✅ ConditionalAppProvider now bypasses ALL authentication
 * ✅ All routes render without AppProvider authentication guard
 * ✅ No authentication checks at the component level
 *
 * WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN NOW:
 * ✅ Login page should be accessible
 * ✅ Main app should also be accessible (without proper auth)
 * ✅ No "Authentication Required" screens
 * ✅ Can identify the source of authentication blocking
 */

/**
 * 🧪 DEBUG TESTING STEPS:
 * =======================
 *
 * TEST 1: Login Page Access
 * ------------------------
 * 1. 🌐 Visit http://localhost:3003/en/login
 * 2. 🔍 Expected: Login form should now render
 * 3. 📊 Check console for ConditionalAppProvider messages
 *
 * TEST 2: Main App Access (Should work even without auth)
 * -----------------------------------------------------
 * 1. 🌐 Visit http://localhost:3003/en
 * 2. 🔍 Expected: Main app should render (temporarily)
 * 3. 📊 This confirms AppProvider was the blocking component
 *
 * TEST 3: Console Analysis
 * -----------------------
 * Look for these messages:
 * - "[ConditionalAppProvider] TEMPORARY: Rendering all routes without authentication guard"
 * - No "[AppProvider] Authentication Required" messages
 * - Clear identification of what was blocking access
 */

/**
 * 🔍 DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION:
 * =========================
 *
 * If login page STILL doesn't work:
 * - Issue is in middleware (but middleware looks correct)
 * - Issue is in login page component itself
 * - Issue is in Next.js routing or hydration
 *
 * If login page WORKS now:
 * - Issue was definitely AppProvider authentication blocking
 * - ConditionalAppProvider logic needs refinement
 * - Route detection or conditional rendering has issues
 *
 * If main app WORKS without authentication:
 * - Confirms our authentication system is properly built
 * - Problem was just component-level blocking
 * - Can restore proper authentication with confidence
 */

/**
 * 📊 EXPECTED CONSOLE OUTPUT:
 * ===========================
 *
 * For ANY route (/login, /, /archive):
 * - "[ConditionalAppProvider] Current path: /en/login (or other)"
 * - "[ConditionalAppProvider] Route path: /login (or other)"
 * - "[ConditionalAppProvider] Is public route: true/false"
 * - "[ConditionalAppProvider] TEMPORARY: Rendering all routes without authentication guard"
 *
 * NO MORE:
 * - "Authentication Required" screens
 * - AppProvider authentication blocking messages
 * - Redirect loops or circular authentication issues
 */

/**
 * 🎯 NEXT STEPS AFTER DEBUGGING:
 * ==============================
 *
 * ONCE LOGIN PAGE WORKS:
 * 1. 🔧 Restore proper authentication for protected routes
 * 2. 🛡️ Keep public routes (login/signup) without authentication
 * 3. 🧪 Test complete authentication flow
 * 4. ✅ Verify production-ready security
 *
 * DEBUGGING COMPLETE:
 * - Identify exact source of blocking
 * - Fix ConditionalAppProvider logic if needed
 * - Restore proper security boundaries
 * - Maintain seamless user experience
