/**
 * 🎉 TOKEN DELETION RECOVERY - ISSUE FIXED! 🎉
 * =============================================
 *
 * The bug where users get redirected to login after access token deletion
 * has been resolved with surgical precision fixes.
 */

console.log("🔧 TOKEN DELETION RECOVERY FIX - COMPLETE!");

/**
 * 🐛 THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM:
 * ========================
 *
 * 1. User is logged in with access_token and refresh_token cookies
 * 2. User manually deletes access_token cookie from browser DevTools
 * 3. User reloads the page
 * 4. App shows "Checking authentication..."
 * 5. New access_token cookie gets created (good!)
 * 6. BUT user still gets redirected to login page (BAD!)
 *
 * 🎯 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
 * TokenManager.checkTokenStatus() immediately returned "logout_required"
 * when no access token was found, bypassing the refresh mechanism entirely.
 */

/**
 * ✅ SURGICAL FIXES APPLIED:
 * ==========================
 */

const fixes = {
  fix1: {
    file: "src/hooks/useAuthenticationGuard.ts",
    method: "TokenManager.checkTokenStatus()",
    change:
      "Return 'needs_refresh' instead of 'logout_required' when access token missing",
    impact: "Allows refresh flow to activate instead of immediate logout",
  },

  fix2: {
    file: "src/hooks/useAuthenticationGuard.ts",
    method: "TokenManager.ensureAuthenticated()",
    change: "Enhanced logging and better error handling",
    impact: "Provides visibility into refresh flow for debugging",
  },

  fix3: {
    file: "src/hooks/useAuthenticationGuard.ts",
    method: "useAuthenticationGuard.checkAuthentication()",
    change: "Added detailed step-by-step logging",
    impact: "Makes it easier to debug authentication issues",
  },

  fix4: {
    file: "src/context/app-provider.tsx",
    method: "Authentication state logging",
    change: "Enhanced logging for state transitions",
    impact: "Better visibility into what happens during token refresh",
  },
};

console.log("Applied fixes:", fixes);

/**
 * 🧪 HOW TO TEST THE FIX:
 * =======================
 *
 * Your app is running at: http://localhost:3003
 *
 * TESTING STEPS:
 * 1. 🌐 Visit http://localhost:3003/en and login normally
 * 2. 🔧 Open DevTools > Application > Cookies > localhost:3003
 * 3. 🗑️ Delete ONLY the "access_token" cookie (keep "refresh_token")
 * 4. 🔄 Reload the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
 *
 * ✅ EXPECTED RESULT (AFTER FIX):
 * - Brief "Checking authentication..." message
 * - Console shows token refresh flow working
 * - New access_token cookie appears automatically
 * - User stays in app (NO redirect to login)
 * - All app functionality works normally
 *
 * 📊 CONSOLE OUTPUT YOU'LL SEE:
 * - "[TokenManager] Token status check result: needs_refresh"
 * - "[TokenManager] Attempting token refresh..."
 * - "[TokenManager] Token refresh successful"
 * - "[useAuthenticationGuard] User authenticated successfully"
 * - "[AppProvider] ✅ User successfully authenticated"
 */

/**
 * 🎯 TECHNICAL EXPLANATION:
 * =========================
 *
 * The fix changes the authentication flow logic:
 *
 * BEFORE (Broken):
 * No access_token → checkTokenStatus() → "logout_required" → redirect to login
 *
 * AFTER (Fixed):
 * No access_token → checkTokenStatus() → "needs_refresh" → refreshAccessToken() → "authenticated" → stay in app
 *
 * This ensures that the refresh_token is properly utilized when the access_token
 * is missing, providing a seamless recovery experience.
 */

/**
 * 🎉 BENEFITS OF THIS FIX:
 * ========================
 *
 * ✅ Seamless token recovery
 * ✅ No unexpected logouts
 * ✅ Better user experience
 * ✅ Automatic token renewal
 * ✅ Preserved app state
 * ✅ Enhanced debugging capability
 * ✅ More resilient authentication flow
