/**
 * 🔐 ADMIN-ONLY ACCESS CONTROL - COMPLETE LOCKDOWN
 * ================================================
 *
 * Updated the role-based access control to make ALL task operations
 * admin-only, including task completion for maximum security and control.
 *
 * 🔄 CHANGE SUMMARY:
 * =================
 *
 * BEFORE (Mixed Access):
 * - AddTask: Admin only ✅
 * - InitiateCompletion: All users ✅
 * - AdjustScore: Admin only ✅
 *
 * AFTER (Admin-Only Access):
 * - AddTask: Admin only ✅
 * - InitiateCompletion: Admin only ✅ (CHANGED)
 * - AdjustScore: Admin only ✅
 *
 * 🎯 What Was Changed:
 * ===================
 *
 * 1. ROLE PERMISSION MATRIX UPDATED ✅
 *    File: src/lib/security/roleValidation.ts
 *    Change: TASK_COMPLETION: [] → ["ADMIN", "admin"]
 *    Impact: All task completion now requires admin role
 *
 * 2. VALIDATION LOGIC SIMPLIFIED ✅
 *    Removed: Early return for unrestricted permissions
 *    Reason: All permissions now require admin roles
 *    Benefit: Cleaner, more consistent code
 *
 * 3. ENDPOINT DOCUMENTATION UPDATED ✅
 *    File: src/app/api/InitiateCompletion/route.ts
 *    Added: "ADMIN ONLY ACCESS" warnings
 *    Updated: Comments and function descriptions
 *
 * 📊 Current Access Control Matrix:
 * ================================
 *
 * | Endpoint           | Admin | Regular User | Status      |
 * |--------------------|-------|--------------|-------------|
 * | AddTask            | ✅    | ❌ 403       | Admin Only  |
 * | InitiateCompletion | ✅    | ❌ 403       | Admin Only  |
 * | AdjustScore        | ✅    | ❌ 403       | Admin Only  |
 * | GetAllTasks        | ✅    | ✅           | Read Access |
 *
 * 🛡️ Security Benefits:
 * ====================
 *
 * CENTRALIZED CONTROL:
 * ✅ All task operations require admin oversight
 * ✅ Prevents unauthorized task manipulation
 * ✅ Ensures proper workflow approval process
 * ✅ Maintains complete audit trail
 *
 * CONSISTENCY:
 * ✅ Uniform security model across all endpoints
 * ✅ Same error messages for all denied access
 * ✅ Predictable behavior for developers
 * ✅ Easier security maintenance
 *
 * COMPLIANCE:
 * ✅ Enhanced control for regulated environments
 * ✅ Clear separation of administrative functions
 * ✅ Comprehensive access logging
 * ✅ Audit-ready security implementation
 *
 * 🔧 Technical Implementation:
 * ===========================
 *
 * Role Permission Configuration:
 * ```typescript
 * export const ROLE_PERMISSIONS = {
 *   SCORE_ADJUSTMENT: ["ADMIN", "admin"],
 *   TASK_MANAGEMENT: ["ADMIN", "admin"],
 *   TASK_COMPLETION: ["ADMIN", "admin"],  // ← CHANGED
 *   USER_MANAGEMENT: ["ADMIN", "admin"],
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Error Response Format (Consistent Across All Endpoints):
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "error": "Insufficient privileges. Admin role required for this operation.",
 *   "errorCode": "INSUFFICIENT_ROLE",
 *   "requiredRoles": ["ADMIN", "admin"],
 *   "userRole": "USER",
 *   "endpoint": "InitiateCompletion"
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * 🔄 Workflow Impact:
 * ==================
 *
 * PREVIOUS WORKFLOW:
 * 1. User sees assigned task
 * 2. User completes task themselves
 * 3. System automatically awards points
 * 4. Admin monitors via dashboard
 *
 * NEW WORKFLOW:
 * 1. User sees assigned task
 * 2. User notifies admin of completion
 * 3. Admin verifies and marks task complete
 * 4. System awards points with admin approval
 * 5. Enhanced oversight and control
 *
 * 📈 Business Benefits:
 * ====================
 *
 * QUALITY CONTROL:
 * ✅ Admin verification of task completion
 * ✅ Prevents false completion claims
 * ✅ Ensures task quality standards
 * ✅ Maintains family accountability
 *
 * OVERSIGHT:
 * ✅ Centralized task management
 * ✅ Complete administrative control
 * ✅ Clear audit trail for all actions
 * ✅ Enhanced family coordination
 *
 * SECURITY:
 * ✅ Prevents unauthorized score manipulation
 * ✅ Ensures proper task workflow
 * ✅ Maintains system integrity
 * ✅ Protects against gaming the system
 *
 * ⚠️ Considerations:
 * =================
 *
 * OPERATIONAL IMPACT:
 * - Admin must be available for task completions
 * - May slow down immediate task completion
 * - Requires admin involvement in daily operations
 * - Could create bottleneck if admin unavailable
 *
 * USER EXPERIENCE:
 * - Regular users cannot self-complete tasks
 * - Requires communication with admin
 * - May reduce immediate gratification
 * - Could impact user engagement if not managed well
 *
 * RECOMMENDATIONS:
 * - Set clear completion request procedures
 * - Establish admin availability schedules
 * - Consider batch approval processes
 * - Implement notification systems for completion requests
 *
 * 🎯 Result: MAXIMUM SECURITY CONTROL!
 * ===================================
 *
 * The system now provides:
 * ✅ Complete administrative control over all task operations
 * ✅ Consistent admin-only access across all endpoints
 * ✅ Enhanced security and audit capabilities
 * ✅ Centralized task management workflow
 * ✅ Protection against unauthorized task manipulation
 * ✅ Enterprise-grade access control implementation
 *
 * This implementation ensures maximum security and control while
 * maintaining the flexibility to adjust permissions as needed.
